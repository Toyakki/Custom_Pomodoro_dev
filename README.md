## Project Title: Automatic Math Problem-Solving Tracking System with Pomodoro Timer

### Description:
This project is an automatic math problem-solving tracking system with a 90-10 min Pomodoro timer, developed using Python and Pygame GUI. The system has the following features:
1. **Pomodoro Timer**: A timer that runs for 90 minutes of work and 10 minutes of break.
2. **Questionnaire**: After each 90-minute study session, a questionnaire window will prompt the user to select and type in the following properties:
    - Math topic number focused on during the session with multi-selection features.
    - Number of problems solved.
    - Number of theorems learned.
3. **Data Recording**: The responses to the questionnaire will be recorded in a CSV file.

### Tech Stacks:
- **Python**: Programming language used for the backend and logic implementation.
- **Pygame GUI**: Used for building the graphical user interface.

### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Project Setup**: Create a new Python project for the automatic math problem-solving tracking system.
2. **Pygame GUI Installation**: Install Pygame GUI using the following command:
   ```python
   pip install pygame_gui
   ```
3. **Backend Development**: Implement the Pomodoro timer functionality and the questionnaire logic using Python and Pygame GUI.
4. **Data Recording**: Implement the functionality to record the questionnaire responses in a CSV file using Python's built-in CSV module.
5. **Testing and Deployment**: Test the application thoroughly and deploy it for use.

By following these steps, you can create the described automatic math problem-solving tracking system with a 90-10 min Pomodoro timer, using Python and Pygame GUI.

The search results provided information about the Pygame GUI and its installation, which is relevant to the project's tech stack. The project's description and tech stacks have been modified accordingly.
